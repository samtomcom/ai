# AI Project

This project aims to be a demonstration of my programming and software development abilities, whilst at the same time allowing me to practice and keep sharp.

I will be initially creating a Genetic Algorithm (GA) library that will connect with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Development will be following a TDD approach, so that new features can be added as required.
The project will initially be simple, but with the concept of extendability in mind so that it can be developed upon further down the line, e.g. backpropogation instead of GA, different activation functions.
